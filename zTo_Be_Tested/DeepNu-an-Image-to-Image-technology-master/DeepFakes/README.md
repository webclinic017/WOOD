# DeepFakes
> Since its inception, Deepfake has been closely tied to words such as fraud and forgery. As long as it appears in people's field of vision, it must be related to new methods of fraud. Although it has been boycotted by the public, this does not reduce the enthusiasm of researchers for the exploration of related technologies, and even the birth of many start-up AI companies. Deepfake 自诞生以来，就与造假、伪造等词语紧紧捆绑在一起，只要出现在人们的视野中，就一定与新的造假方法有关。虽然遭到了公众的联合抵制，但是这并不能削减研究人员对相关技术探索的热情，甚至由此诞生了许多初创AI公司。
