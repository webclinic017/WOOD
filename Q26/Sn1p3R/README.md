# Sn1p3R

## Our Enemy is RANGE!

Our mission is to identify and lock our enemy. 

When our target is acquired, we'll deploy our agents to get a pullback window entry, and snipe our secondary target.

Then, we'll determine for our agents the best time's window for exfiltration, and will execute it.
