<div class="notes"><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><ol class="paralist"><li>Most stock exchange transactions settle on the trade date plus two business days. Options, futures and US open-end mutual fund transactions settle on trade date plus one business day. (Some exchanges and other transaction types may have longer or shorter settlement periods.) Ending settled cash reflects the cash that has actually settled.  </li><li>Initial and maintenance margin requirements are available within the Account Window of the Trader Workstation.</li><li>Quantities preceded by a "-" sign indicate sell transactions. Other transactions are purchases. </li><li>In case of partial executions, commissions are charged on the total quantity executed on the original order. The commission is displayed on the first partial execution only.</li><li>Each closed lot indicated above with a reference to note (6) was chosen by the end of the trading day to be sold versus the specific opening purchase identified in that row.</li><li>Trade execution times are displayed in Eastern Time.</li><li>Applicable commodity Regulatory Fees for your transactions are available on the IB website at <a href='http://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/accounts/fees/exchangeAndRegulatoryFees.php'>www.interactivebrokers.com/en/accounts/fees/exchangeAndRegulatoryFees.php</a>.</li><li>Borrow Fee Rate represents the cost to borrow stock expressed in percent per annum. It is applied to the cash collateral amount on the stock borrow contract and is separate from any interest earned on credit cash balances. Similarly, Loan Fee Rate represents the benefit to lend stock. A positive rate indicates a cost to the borrower/benefit to the lender and a negative rate indicates a benefit to the borrower/cost to the lender. In general, the fee rates for hard-to-borrow stocks are higher than for normal availability stocks.</li><li>Interest Rate on Customer Collateral represents the interest paid on the collateral posted to the customer's account and received from lending stock.  A positive rate indicates a benefit to the lender.</li><li>The closing prices on this Activity Statement are indicative and may come from third-party sources. Interactive Brokers does not warrant the accuracy of the prices provided by third-party sources. Due to time zone differences, certain non-US mutual funds may deliver closing prices after the Activity Statement has been produced and the closing prices for such funds will reflect the previous day's price.</li><li>Additional information about your retail Forex transactions is available in Account Management, including information required under NFA Rule 2-36(o) about retail Forex trades in the same currency pair as any retail leveraged Forex transaction you executed in your IB account. We can provide this information for trades executed within the 15 minutes immediately before and after your trade. This information is available for a period of 6 months after your trade.</li></ol><p><strong>Fixed Income Notes</strong></p><ol class="paralist"><li>Call features for bonds or preferred stocks may affect the yield. For zero coupon, compound interest and multiplier securities, there are no periodic payments and securities may be callable below maturity value without notice to holder unless registered. For asset-backed securities, the actual yield may vary depending on the speed at which the underlying note is pre-paid. For additional information regarding bond yield, please contact the IB Help Desk at: <a href='mailto:help@interactivebrokers.com'>help@interactivebrokers.com</a>. If this debt security is unrated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, it may pose a high risk of default. You should consult a financial advisor to determine whether unrated bonds are appropriate for your portfolio in light of your goals and your financial circumstances. Fees charged by bond trading centers are included in the cost of bond transactions.</li></ol><p><strong>Legal Notes</strong></p><ol class="paralist"><li><strong>Please promptly report any inaccuracy or discrepancy in this statement, or in your account.
